						I remember when I was back in school in San Diego, a wildfire ravaged the county during
						California wildfire season, turning the skies orange and black with smoke. It was a terrible
						event, killing several people and causing billions of dollars in damages. Not only were lives
						lost, but also livelihoods. This COVID19 pandemic has already taken far more lives and done far
						more damage than those California wildfires, causing numerous states to issue a shelter-in-place
						directive with no end in sight. And similar to the wildfires, lives are being lost and
						livelihoods changing. Although both of these events are not to be treated lightly and demand our
						respect, it is also important to acknowledge that there are often multiple perspectives on every
						event, even catastrophic ones, and that changes to our livelihood are not always bad.
					</p>
					<p>
						The California wildfires had the side effect of shutting down classes for a week, which enabled
						me to prioritize other aspects of my life. This shift in priority ultimately turned out to be
						life-changing in retrospect, but I would never have known that at the time. In our current
						situation, it is too early to tell if any changes I make will be life-changing in the future,
						but here are some that come to mind:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I've started reconnecting with friends that don't live in the bay area. Because you can't
							meet with people in real life anymore, video calling people 10 miles away is the same as
							video calling people 1000 miles away (except for timezone changes).</li>
						<li>I've started recycling more aggressively. Because I'm at home much more, I also generate a
							lot more trash, often overflowing my trash bin.</li>
						<li>I've refreshed my disaster kit. California is wildfire, drought, earthquake, and now (only
							temporarily I hope) pandemic country. Disaster preparedness is everyone's responsibility
							because there are only a limited number of professional first-responders.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						There are also other anecdotal stories involving societal empathy among teachers, healthcare
						workers, grocery store workers, extroverts, and many more. These stories help to strengthen our
						human connection and understanding of others. As we go through this challenging time, it is
						important to keep an open perspective on things. We must do our best to protect those most
						vulnerable in our community by sheltering-in-place and social distancing, but also pay attention
						to changes in our livelihood that may ultimately help us. As Buddha once said, "Nothing is
						forever except change".

						One thing I've learned from my sitting practice is that sometimes I feel things physically
						before I fully process my thoughts. This seems especially true in rapid times of change like
						this. I know I've been feeling grief over the last two weeks and I see it around me too. I'm
						glad we can walk through it together (metaphorically) and I have trust that holding compassion
						and patience will help us. I hope everyone is working with their community in that spirit.

						As I settle in (4 weeks already) for what I expect to be a year+ long new lifestyle of social
						seclusion, working from home, close and tight interactions with my wife and two (out of three)
						grown children plus our 7 month old puppy, I can only feel an intense sense of calm, and comfort
						in the knowledge that the new virtual practice at 5:30am followed by the wonderful virtual
						coffee meeting provides a steadying mantle of peace, support and connection that will help me to
						not only continue to stick to the practice, but most importantly, feel a strong sense of
						connection to a group of people I value and respect, because in their similitude (Zen practice)
						they are all different.
					</p>
					<p>
						I started going to Kannon-do almost 2 years to the start of the Coronavirus measures here in the
						Bay Area. Not really knowing why, but trusting my instincts in the journey I was on, it proved
						crucial in helping me manage my Stage IV lung cancer diagnosis a few months later. For a few
						weeks here or there, for various reasons during these 2 years, I meditated at home when I wasn't
						able to go to the zendo in the early mornings. It didn't feel that different and several months
						after I started, I could do the 40 minutes at home by myself. I didn't really know what the
						difference of doing it by myself vs. going to the zendo (other than being able to sleep longer)
						truly was. Well, if I didn't go in the morning, I couldn't go to coffee afterward, which from
						the very early days, became a hugely important part of the morning routine. Without those
						Starbucks mornings, I would not have been able to meet, talk to and learn from the small group
						that goes to coffee, which on its own, made a huge difference.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, in addition to the morning coffee meetings, I decided that the most important reason
						to continue to wake up earlier in the mornings to go to Kannon-do for Zazen, was to prevent the
						risk of slowly drifting away from the practice if I just decided to do it alone. Or so I
						thought. In this new crisis we are living, I realize that keeping together, even virtually, is
						about so much more. Our new virtual morning Zazen followed by the virtual coffee chat, on the
						surface are a detrimental experience to the real thing. But if you stop to think for a moment
						(or feel), this is just a different "real", with no reason to compare it to the previous one.
						It's real because it's now. It will change someday, which for me might be much longer than for
						others, but we know that will happen with everything.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, it's teaching me to just live the now I have, and to try to live it proactively.
						It's giving me time to read and learn new things. I go on walks around the neighborhood with my
						camera and take simple photos of things that I see (mostly flowers or plants) that are now. Take
						my bicycle and explore new low traffic roads. My eBike is another example that you need to do
						what is right for you now, and not what you thought or others told you is or isn't right. What
						an enabler, to be able to climb hills and mountains without overdoing the exercise. Not being
						confined to flat roads as I build my conditioning and endurance, so I can also reinforce my
						immune system instead of weakening it by over stressing my body with "good" exercise.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a time of new learnings and opportunities, of adapting to change and continuing our
						journeys. When I was first dealing with my cancer diagnosis, I came across a key question that
						paralyzed me for a while: What is your reason to live? But it meant your own reason, not living
						for others, or external reasons. If you ask the question yourself, and remove the usual answers
						(for my children, spouse, parents, etc.), what is left? Why do you want to live? I'm not going
						to describe the process I went through, but in the end, my answer (and decision) to live, simply
						came to: I want to see where this journey will take me, what new surprises and experiences and
						learnings await me! I have no idea what they are, but I do want to see where it ends. And since
						that day, what I've lived through and done have amazed me. One day at a time, some better than
						others, all to be lived one by one. The virtual new Kannon-do practice helps me start each new
						day in the right place, even if for some reason I can't join. It's always there.
